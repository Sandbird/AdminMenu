ADK ESO Multi-Tool
==============
This is a tool for managing map based databases for things such as gathering nods and or any other nodes you wish visible on your map using various items such as shards and or what every else needed.

Eventually there will be a Add-on created to work along side this application to be a all in one map feature.

the idea behind this game from World of War-craft gathering plugin/tool I used to use.

Developers
==============
I use the latest version of wxFormBuilder to use to design the GUI
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/files/wxformbuilder-nightly/3.4.2-beta/
Make sure to backup the original files before regenerating the GUI files.
With changes in the GUI make sure make a copy to be able to port over the changes quickly as the program wipes the files clean of any changes and creates new files.
